### Question 3:
Can you explain how MongoDB's aggregation framework works and provide an example of a simple aggregation pipeline?



### MongoDB Aggregation Framework:

The aggregation framework in MongoDB is a powerful tool for processing and analyzing data. It allows you to perform operations like filtering, transforming, grouping, and sorting data, much like SQL's `GROUP BY`, `JOIN`, and `WHERE` clauses. The aggregation framework uses a pipeline approach, where data passes through multiple stages, each performing a specific operation.

### Key Stages in an Aggregation Pipeline:
1. **`$match`**: Filters documents based on a condition (similar to `WHERE` in SQL).
2. **`$group`**: Groups documents by a specified key and can perform operations like counting, summing, averaging, etc.
3. **`$project`**: Shapes the output by specifying which fields to include or exclude.
4. **`$sort`**: Sorts the documents based on a specified field.
5. **`$limit`**: Limits the number of documents returned.
6. **`$skip`**: Skips a specified number of documents.
7. **`$unwind`**: Deconstructs an array field into multiple documents.

### Example of a Simple Aggregation Pipeline:
Suppose we have a collection of sales data, and we want to calculate the total sales for each product:

```json
{
  "_id": 1,
  "product": "Laptop",
  "price": 1000,
  "quantity": 2
},
{
  "_id": 2,
  "product": "Phone",
  "price": 500,
  "quantity": 5
},
{
  "_id": 3,
  "product": "Laptop",
  "price": 1000,
  "quantity": 3
}
```

To calculate the total sales for each product, we can use the following aggregation pipeline:

```javascript
db.sales.aggregate([
  { $group: { 
      _id: "$product", 
      totalSales: { $sum: { $multiply: ["$price", "$quantity"] } } 
    } 
  },
  { $sort: { totalSales: -1 } } // Sorts by totalSales in descending order
])
```

### Explanation:
- **`$group`**: Groups the documents by the `product` field. For each group, it calculates the `totalSales` by multiplying the `price` by the `quantity` and summing the results.
- **`$sort`**: Sorts the results by `totalSales` in descending order.

### Result:
The result will show the total sales for each product, sorted by the highest sales.

MongoDB's aggregation framework is highly flexible and powerful, allowing for complex data transformations and analyses.

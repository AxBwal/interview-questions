### what is hof in react with example. give simple example

A Higher-Order Function (HOF) in React (or JavaScript in general) is a function that either takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as a result. Higher-order functions are commonly used for handling things like callbacks, currying, or creating utilities.

### Simple Example of a Higher-Order Function:

Letâ€™s create a simple Higher-Order Function that takes a function as an argument and enhances it with additional behavior.

### Example: Logging Function Calls

```javascript
// Higher-Order Function that adds logging behavior
function withLogging(fn) {
  return function(...args) {
    console.log(`Calling function ${fn.name} with arguments:`, args);
    return fn(...args);
  };
}

// Simple function that adds two numbers
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Enhance the 'add' function with logging
const addWithLogging = withLogging(add);

// Using the enhanced function
const result = addWithLogging(2, 3); // Logs: Calling function add with arguments: [2, 3]
console.log(result); // 5
```

### Explanation:
- **`withLogging` HOF:** This function takes another function (`fn`) as an argument and returns a new function that logs the arguments before calling the original function.
- **`add` function:** A basic function that adds two numbers.
- **`addWithLogging`:** The `add` function enhanced with logging. When you call it, it logs the arguments and then returns the sum.

### Usage in React:
In React, you might use Higher-Order Functions for things like handling events, managing state, or enhancing component behavior. For example, you could use an HOF to create reusable event handlers that include additional logic.

This concept is similar to Higher-Order Components (HOCs), but HOFs are more general and can be used with any functions, not just React components.

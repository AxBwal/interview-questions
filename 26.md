**Question:** How does JavaScript handle inheritance with prototypes? Give an example of how one object can inherit properties from another.

### Explanation:

In JavaScript, every object has a prototype. A prototype is another object from which the original object inherits properties and methods. Prototypal inheritance allows an object to access properties and methods from another object, enabling code reuse and shared behavior across instances.

When you access a property on an object, JavaScript will first look for that property on the object itself. If it doesn't find it, it will continue searching the object's prototype, and so on, up the prototype chain until it either finds the property or reaches the end of the chain (`null`).

### Example:

```javascript
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function() {
  return `Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`;
};

function Student(name, age, grade) {
  Person.call(this, name, age); // Call the Person constructor
  this.grade = grade;
}

Student.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype); // Inherit from Person
Student.prototype.constructor = Student;

Student.prototype.study = function() {
  return `${this.name} is studying for grade ${this.grade}.`;
};

// Creating an instance of Student
const student1 = new Student('John', 21, 'A');

console.log(student1.greet()); // Inherited from Person
console.log(student1.study()); // Defined in Student
```

### Breakdown:
1. **Person Function:** This is a constructor function for creating `Person` objects. It has a method `greet` defined on its prototype.
2. **Student Function:** This is another constructor function, but it inherits from `Person`. We use `Person.call(this, name, age)` to ensure the `Student` constructor initializes the `name` and `age` properties from `Person`.
3. **Inheritance:** `Student.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);` sets up prototypal inheritance. `Student.prototype.constructor = Student;` ensures the constructor is correctly assigned.
4. **Instance:** When you create an instance of `Student`, it has access to both the `greet` method from `Person` and the `study` method from `Student`.

### Output:
```javascript
student1.greet(); // "Hello, my name is John."
student1.study(); // "John is studying for grade A."
```

This shows how `Student` inherits from `Person` and adds its own methods while reusing `Person`'s behavior.

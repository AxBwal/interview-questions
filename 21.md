### what  is lazy laoding

Lazy loading is a design pattern used primarily in web development to delay the loading of non-critical resources (like images, videos, or scripts) until they are actually needed. Instead of loading all resources upfront, which can slow down the initial load time, lazy loading loads only the necessary content first and then loads other resources as they come into the user's viewport or become necessary for the user to interact with.

### Example:
For images, instead of loading all images on a webpage when it first loads, lazy loading will load images only when the user scrolls down to the part of the page where those images are displayed. This improves the performance and user experience by reducing the initial load time and saving bandwidth.

### Key Benefits:
- **Improved Performance:** Faster initial page loads.
- **Reduced Bandwidth Usage:** Loads only whatâ€™s needed.
- **Better User Experience:** Users can start interacting with the content more quickly.

This pattern is widely used in modern web development frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js, often in conjunction with components or routes.

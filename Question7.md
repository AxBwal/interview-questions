### Question 7:
You’re working on a Node.js application, and the server suddenly crashes during high traffic. How would you diagnose and resolve the issue?

Rate limiting is indeed a useful strategy to prevent servers from being overwhelmed during high traffic, but it’s typically a preventive measure rather than a direct diagnosis or resolution method when a crash has already occurred.

Here’s a more comprehensive approach to diagnosing and resolving the issue:

### Diagnosis:
1. **Check the Logs**:
   - Review server logs to identify the root cause of the crash. Logs may show errors like memory leaks, unhandled exceptions, or database connection issues.

2. **Monitor Resource Usage**:
   - Use tools like `pm2`, `top`, or `htop` to monitor CPU and memory usage. High resource consumption might indicate inefficient code, infinite loops, or memory leaks.

3. **Check for Unhandled Exceptions**:
   - Ensure that all asynchronous operations (promises, callbacks) have proper error handling. Unhandled exceptions can cause the server to crash.

4. **Analyze Traffic Patterns**:
   - Determine if the crash coincides with a traffic spike. If so, the server may be overwhelmed by too many requests at once.

### Resolution:
1. **Implement Rate Limiting**:
   - As you mentioned, applying rate limiting using middleware like `express-rate-limit` can help control the number of requests to prevent the server from being overwhelmed.

2. **Optimize Database Queries**:
   - If the crash is due to slow database queries, consider indexing, query optimization, or caching to reduce the load.

3. **Use a Load Balancer**:
   - Distribute traffic across multiple servers using a load balancer to prevent any single server from becoming overloaded.

4. **Scale Horizontally**:
   - Add more instances of your server (horizontal scaling) to handle increased traffic.

5. **Graceful Error Handling**:
   - Ensure that all errors are handled gracefully. Use a global error handler to catch and respond to errors without crashing the server.

6. **Increase Timeouts**:
   - If requests are timing out, you might need to adjust timeouts or optimize the response times of your services.

7. **Implement Circuit Breakers**:
   - Use circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures when a service is down or overloaded.

This approach combines preventive measures like rate limiting with diagnostic steps to identify and resolve the root cause of the crash.

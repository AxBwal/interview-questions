### what is cors and why we use in js 

**CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**  is a security feature in web browsers that controls how web pages can request resources from a different domain than the one they are on. It ensures that only allowed domains can access resources, helping to protect against unauthorized data access.

### Why We Use CORS in JavaScript:

1. **Security**: By default, web browsers implement the same-origin policy. This policy restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. This prevents malicious websites from fetching data from your domain without permission.

2. **Cross-Origin Requests**: Modern web applications often need to request resources from different origins (e.g., API servers, CDNs). CORS allows servers to specify who can access their resources and how access is handled.

3. **Headers**: When a web browser makes a cross-origin HTTP request (e.g., using `fetch` or `XMLHttpRequest` in JavaScript), the browser first sends a preflight request with an `OPTIONS` method to check if the server allows the actual request. The server can respond with appropriate headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, etc.) to indicate which origins are allowed and what methods can be used.

4. **Usage**: In JavaScript, CORS errors typically occur when you try to make a request to a resource hosted on another domain and the server does not return the required headers to allow that request. To resolve this, the server must be configured to handle CORS by allowing the origin making the request.

### Example Scenario:
Imagine you're building a web application running on `http://example.com`, and you want to fetch data from an API at `https://api.example.com`. The browser will block this request unless the server at `https://api.example.com` responds with appropriate CORS headers, such as `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://example.com`.

**CORS is essential for enabling secure and controlled resource sharing across different origins in web applications.**

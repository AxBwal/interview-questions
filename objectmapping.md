### What is object mapping in mongodb

Object mapping in MongoDB refers to the process of connecting objects in an application’s code (such as those in JavaScript, Python, or any other language) to documents stored in a MongoDB database. This connection is often handled by an **Object-Document Mapper (ODM)**. An ODM is a library or framework that allows developers to interact with the MongoDB database using an object-oriented approach rather than dealing directly with the database's underlying document structure.

### Key Concepts in Object Mapping with MongoDB

1. **Documents and Collections**:
   - MongoDB stores data as documents in collections. Each document is a JSON-like structure with key-value pairs.
   - Collections are analogous to tables in a relational database.

2. **Models**:
   - Models represent the schema of a collection and provide an interface to interact with the documents. They are created based on schemas, which define the structure and types of data allowed in the documents.

3. **Schema Definition**:
   - In an ODM, you define a schema for your model, which ensures that your documents have a consistent structure. This schema maps the data fields of your application’s objects to fields in a MongoDB document.

4. **CRUD Operations**:
   - The ODM handles create, read, update, and delete operations using familiar object-oriented methods, abstracting away the raw MongoDB queries.

### Example: Mongoose ODM in Node.js

Mongoose is a popular ODM for Node.js and MongoDB. Here’s how object mapping works with Mongoose:

1. **Define a Schema**:
   ```javascript
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');

   // Define a schema
   const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
     name: {
       type: String,
       required: true
     },
     email: {
       type: String,
       required: true,
       unique: true
     },
     age: {
       type: Number,
       min: 0
     }
   });
   ```

2. **Create a Model**:
   ```javascript
   // Create a model
   const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
   ```

3. **Perform CRUD Operations**:
   ```javascript
   // Create a new user
   const newUser = new User({ name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com', age: 30 });
   newUser.save().then(user => console.log(user)).catch(err => console.error(err));

   // Find a user by email
   User.findOne({ email: 'john@example.com' }).then(user => console.log(user)).catch(err => console.error(err));
   ```

### Benefits of Object Mapping

- **Simplified Database Interaction**: Developers can work with objects and methods, avoiding complex query syntax.
- **Validation and Schema Enforcement**: Object mapping ensures that documents follow a consistent schema.
- **Easy Data Manipulation**: ODMs like Mongoose provide utilities for data manipulation, hooks, and middleware.

### Summary

Object mapping in MongoDB involves using an ODM like Mongoose to map application objects to MongoDB documents. This approach simplifies database interactions by providing an object-oriented interface to manage data.

what is usememo . and say its example

`useMemo` is a React hook that memoizes the result of a computation. It helps optimize performance by recomputing a value only when its dependencies change, rather than on every render. This is particularly useful for expensive calculations or when you want to avoid unnecessary re-renders caused by recalculating the same value multiple times.

### Simple Explanation:
- `useMemo` caches the result of a function between renders, recalculating it only when one of its dependencies changes.
- This helps prevent unnecessary recalculations, improving performance.

### Syntax:
```javascript
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
```

### Example:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react';

function ExpensiveComputationComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [text, setText] = useState('');

  // Memoized value that only recalculates when count changes
  const expensiveCalculation = useMemo(() => {
    console.log('Computing expensive value...');
    // Simulating an expensive calculation
    let result = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++) {
      result += i;
    }
    return result + count;
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Expensive Calculation Result: {expensiveCalculation}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment Count</button>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={text}
        onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Type something..."
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default ExpensiveComputationComponent;
```

### Explanation:
- The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize the result of an expensive calculation.
- The `expensiveCalculation` function is only recalculated when the `count` value changes. If you type in the input field, `count` doesn’t change, so the expensive calculation is not re-run.
- Without `useMemo`, the expensive calculation would be executed on every render, even when it’s unnecessary, which could slow down the application.

`useMemo` is typically used when you have a calculation that is intensive or when you want to avoid unnecessary re-renders by caching the result of a computation that depends on specific dependencies.

### Explain how the event loop works in JavaScript.



### The Event Loop in JavaScript:
1. **Global Execution Context**:
   - JavaScript first executes the code in the global execution context, which includes functions, variables, and any synchronous code.

2. **Call Stack**:
   - The call stack is a stack structure that keeps track of the execution of functions. When a function is invoked, it is pushed onto the call stack, and when it returns, it is popped off.

3. **Web APIs**:
   - When asynchronous operations like `setTimeout`, `fetch`, DOM events, or Promises are encountered, they are handed off to the browserâ€™s Web APIs (or Node.js APIs in a server environment).

4. **Callback Queue (Task Queue)**:
   - After the Web APIs finish their work, the callbacks (e.g., from `setTimeout`) are placed in the callback queue (also known as the task queue).

5. **Microtask Queue**:
   - Promises and MutationObservers are placed in the microtask queue, which has higher priority than the callback queue.

6. **Event Loop**:
   - The event loop continuously checks the call stack to see if it's empty.
   - If the call stack is empty, the event loop first checks the microtask queue. If there are tasks in the microtask queue, they are moved to the call stack for execution.
   - Only after the microtask queue is empty does the event loop check the callback queue, moving tasks from the callback queue to the call stack one by one.

7. **Execution**:
   - The call stack executes functions and pops them off after execution. This cycle continues, ensuring that all tasks, both synchronous and asynchronous, are handled efficiently.

 The key point to emphasize is that the event loop gives priority to the microtask queue before moving to the callback queue, ensuring that microtasks are executed as soon as possible.

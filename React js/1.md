**Question 1:**
Can you explain the difference between `props` and `state` in React? How and when would you use each?



-  `state` is used for managing data that changes over time and is specific to a component. Itâ€™s mutable and can be updated using `setState` in class components or the `useState` hook in functional components.
- `Props`, on the other hand, are used to pass data and event handlers from a parent component to a child component. Props are immutable and should not be modified by the child component.

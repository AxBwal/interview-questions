**Question 3:**
How do you handle side effects in React functional components?





-  `useEffect` is used to handle side effects in React functional components and that it includes a dependency array.
- For a more complete answer, you could mention specific examples of side effects, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM. Additionally, you could clarify that the dependency array controls when the effect runs: if it's empty, the effect runs only once after the initial render; if it contains dependencies, the effect runs whenever those dependencies change.
- Also, mentioning the cleanup function within `useEffect` to clean up any resources or subscriptions when the component unmounts would strengthen your answer.

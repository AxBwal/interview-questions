**Question 5:**
Can you explain the concept of "lifting state up" in React and provide an example of when and why you would use it?


- You correctly mentioned that "lifting state up" involves passing state from a child component to a parent component to share it with other child components. 

- "Lifting state up" specifically refers to moving state management to the closest common ancestor of components that need access to that state. It allows sibling components to communicate through their shared parent.

- Prop drilling is the process of passing data through many layers of components, which can be simplified using context or state management libraries like Redux or Recoil.

- Providing a simple example, such as a parent component managing a form's input state and passing that state down to child components for displaying or modifying, would strengthen your answer.

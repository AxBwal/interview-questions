**Question 6:**
What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in React? When would you use each?


You were able to answer the question. Here’s the feedback:


-  Controlled components manage their state through React state (using `useState` or similar), whereas uncontrolled components manage their state via the DOM directly, often using refs.
- For a more complete answer, you could mention specific use cases: 
  - Controlled components are preferred when you need more control over the form data and validation, as they ensure that the component state is always in sync with the input values.
  - Uncontrolled components might be used when you want to avoid the overhead of managing state through React or when dealing with large forms where performance might be a concern.
- Also, emphasizing that controlled components provide a way to handle form submissions and validations within React’s state system, while uncontrolled components let the DOM handle the input state, would clarify the concepts further.

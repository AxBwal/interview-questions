**Question 4:**
What are React Hooks, and can you name a few common ones along with their use cases?



-  React Hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. You also named several common hooks and provided their use cases.
- For improvement, you might want to clarify that hooks are a way to use state and lifecycle features in functional components. 
- `useState` manages state within a component, `useEffect` handles side effects, `useMemo` optimizes performance by memoizing values, and `useCallback` memoizes functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Adding brief explanations for `useMemo` and `useCallback` would make your answer more comprehensive.

**Question 2:**
What is the virtual DOM, and how does React use it to optimize rendering?

Thanks for your response. Hereâ€™s the feedback:


-  The virtual DOM is a lightweight in-memory representation of the real DOM. React creates a virtual DOM for every state change, then compares it with a previous version using a process called "reconciliation." React then calculates the minimum number of changes needed to update the real DOM and applies those changes, which helps improve performance.
